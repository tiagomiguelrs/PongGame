# Pong Game

## Description
This project is a classic Pong game implemented using Python's turtle module. The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard. Players control the paddles to hit the ball back and forth, trying to score points by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 3.

## Features
Two-player Mode: Control the left paddle with the W and S keys, and the right paddle with the Up and Down arrow keys.

Scoreboard: Keeps track of the score for both players and displays a game over message when a player wins.

Ball Movement: The ball moves around the screen, bouncing off walls and paddles.

Collision Detection: Detects collisions between the ball and the paddles or walls to change the ball's direction.

## How to Play
Control the Paddles: Use the W and S keys to move the left paddle up and down. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.

Score Points: Hit the ball with your paddle to send it towards your opponent. Score a point when the ball passes your opponent's paddle.

Win the Game: The first player to reach a score of 3 wins the game.
